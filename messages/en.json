Unlike traditional file converters, ConvertOnline processes most files locally on your browser, ensuring your files never leave your device and providing fast, private conversions."},"supported_formats":{"title":"What file formats are supported?","description":"ConvertOnline supports over <b>250+ file formats</b> across four main categories:<br/><br/><b>Images:</b> JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, SVG, and many more<br/><b>Audio:</b> MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, M4A, and more<br/><b>Documents:</b> PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT, RTF, EPUB, HTML, and more<br/><b>Video:</b> MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM, and more<br/><br/>You can see all supported formats when you upload a file and select the conversion format."},"file_size":{"title":"Is there a file size limit?","description":"No! ConvertOnline has <b>no file size limits</b> for most conversions. However, very large video files may have browser limitations. For files larger than a few GB, we recommend using Firefox or Safari as they typically have higher memory limits."},"conversion_location":{"title":"Where does the conversion happen?","description":"Most conversions (images, audio, and documents) happen <b>entirely on your device</b> using WebAssembly. This means your files never leave your computer, ensuring privacy and fast conversion speeds. Video conversions are performed on our servers due to the high processing requirements, but you can also set up your own local video conversion server."},"video_conversion":{"title":"How does video conversion work?","description":"Video files require more processing power than can be efficiently handled in a browser, so they are uploaded to our servers for conversion. Your videos are automatically deleted after being downloaded, or after one hour if not converted. You can also configure your own local video conversion server in the [settings_link]Settings[/settings_link] page for complete privacy."},"filename":{"title":"Can I customize the output filename?","description":"Yes! You can customize the filename format in the [settings_link]Settings[/settings_link] page. Use templates like <b>%name%</b> for the original filename, <b>%extension%</b> for the original extension, and <b>%date%</b> for the conversion date. For example, <code>ConvertOnline_%name%</code> will create files like <code>ConvertOnline_photo.jpg</code>."},"default_format":{"title":"Can I set a default conversion format?","description":"Yes! In the [settings_link]Settings[/settings_link] page, you can set default conversion formats for each file type (images, videos, audio, documents). When you upload a file, it will automatically select your preferred format, saving you time."},"quality":{"title":"How do I adjust conversion quality?","description":"You can adjust the conversion quality in the [settings_link]Settings[/settings_link] page. Higher quality settings will result in better output but may take longer to convert and produce larger files. You can set different quality levels for images (percentage), audio (bitrate in kbps), and videos."},"metadata":{"title":"Will file metadata be preserved?","description":"You can choose whether to keep or remove metadata (like EXIF data in images, song info in audio files) in the [settings_link]Settings[/settings_link] page. By default, metadata is preserved, but you can remove it for privacy or to reduce file size."},"batch":{"title":"Can I convert multiple files at once?","description":"Yes! You can upload multiple files at once and convert them all together. Use the \"Convert all\" button to process all files, or convert them individually. You can also download all converted files as a ZIP archive using the \"Download all\" button."},"errors":{"title":"What should I do if conversion fails?","description":"If a conversion fails, you'll see an error message with details. For video conversions, you may be asked if you want to submit the error to help us fix bugs. Common issues include unsupported formats, corrupted files, or browser limitations. Try refreshing the page or using a different browser if problems persist."},"cache":{"title":"What is the cache and how do I clear it?","description":"ConvertOnline caches converter files in your browser to improve performance and reduce data usage. These cached files are stored locally and don't contain any personal data. You can view or clear the cache in the [settings_link]Settings[/settings_link] page under \"Privacy & data\"."}}}
